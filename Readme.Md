# python FireStore

> Python firestore realtime simple CRUD app.

### Setup

The following steps will walk you through installation on a Mac. Linux should be similar.
It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps.
If you've developed Django apps on Windows, you should have little problem getting
up and running.

#### Dependencies
###### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.9 


Create virtualenv in your system then follow the comments:
```` virtualenv venv --python=python3.10 ````

If you successfully create the virtualenv then activate:
```source venv/bin/activate```
