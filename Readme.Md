# python FireStore

> Python firestore realtime simple CRUD app.

### Setup

The following steps will walk you through installation on a Mac. Linux should be similar.
It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps.
If you've developed Django apps on Windows, you should have little problem getting
up and running.
